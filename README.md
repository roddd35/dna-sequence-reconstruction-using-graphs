# dna-sequence-reconstruction-using-graphs
A project made for MAC0323 | Algorithms and Data Structures II class at University of SÃ£o Paulo, based on applying graph theory to reconstruct a DNA sequence given an input file
This project has the idea of, given a series of DNA sequence divided into pieces, we want to apply graph theory algorithms to try our best reconstructing this sequence the way it's supposed to be. That way, we want the slashes of DNA sequence to have an intersection in between one another, in order to do so the best way possible
